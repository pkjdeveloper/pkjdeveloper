Hi there 👋

Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile, it's great to meet you here! 😊

Here are some quick things about me:
<ul>
<li>🔭 I'm a software engineer who is paranoid about convention, consistency, and constraints.</li>
<li>🕵️‍♀️ I like doing quality work.</li>
<li>🧸 I'm proud of who I am, what I have built, and what I am building.</li>
<li>🧑‍💻 Coding is my passion.</li>
<li>📫 The best way to reach me is to send me Skype pankaj.saini901</li>
<li>⚡ Fun fact: I once drove to the Half Moon Bay for sun rise.</li>
 </ul>
